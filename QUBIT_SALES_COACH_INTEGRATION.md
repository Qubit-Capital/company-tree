# Qubit-Sales-Coach Integration

- The Qubit-Sales-Coach repository has been added as a subdirectory under `/Qubit-Sales-Coach`.
- This was done on the `feature/integrate-sales-coach` branch, following the workflow rules.
- No files were merged into the main project; all original files remain untouched.
- To work on the Sales Coach project, go into the `Qubit-Sales-Coach` directory and follow its README/setup instructions.

---

## Next Steps
- Review the README in `/Qubit-Sales-Coach` for setup and usage.
- If you need to make changes to the Sales Coach code, do so in this branch and commit as usual.
- When ready, you can merge this feature branch into main or another integration branch as per your workflow.
